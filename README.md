## Why I made Penelope AI

I created Penelope AI for two reasons.

The first is to solve my own problem.
I am not very good at writing, so much so that it is very hard for me to think of a headline for a landing page.

So I wanted to create an application that would allow me to write intriguing texts even though I am not good at that.

The second reason was that I wanted to use the power of AI ðŸ¤–

AI has made remarkable progress this year, and if you look on Twitter, someone is posting a thread about AI every day.
I wanted to try out new technologies right away, so I took this opportunity to introduce AI into my product.
